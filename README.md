“A mind is like a parachute. It doesn’t work if it is not open.” - Frank Zappa.-

Hey, I'm Eze, a Senior Engineering Leader with 18+ years in tech. Love building stuff and working with great teams. I’ve gone from coding to leading, always focused on making cool things happen.

Basically, I'm all about:
- Leading and growing engineering teams.
- Making tech better and stronger.
- Setting tech plans to help the business do well.
- Getting products built and out there.
- Making our work smoother.
- Finding and helping awesome engineers.

Started out coding, and now I’m leading teams, always pushing for great outcomes. Been lucky to lead in different industries, solving problems and building strong engineering groups, I like getting involved and value both good tech and teamwork. I think working together is key to achieving a lot.

Always up for connecting with others in tech to share stories and see what's next. Drop me an [email](e@maraschio.com) anytime!
